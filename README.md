# Doubly Linked List in Java

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** in Java. It supports various standard operations like inserting and deleting elements from the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list. The program also displays the state of the list after each operation with clear output messages.

## 🚀 Features

- Insert at Beginning  
- Insert at End  
- Insert at Specific Position (1-based index)  
- Delete from Beginning  
- Delete from End  
- Delete from Specific Position  
- Display the list after every operation

┣ 📄 DoublyLinkedList.java
┗ 📄 README.md

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

### Step 1: Compile the Program 

javac DoublyLinkedList.java

### Step 2: Run the Program

java DoublyLinkedList

# 💻 Sample Output:

InsertAtEnd (first element): List: 10 --> Null
InsertAtEnd: List: 10 20 --> Null
InsertAtEnd: List: 10 20 30 --> Null
InsertAtBeginning: List: 5 10 20 30 --> Null
InsertAtPosition(3): List: 5 10 15 20 30 --> Null
DeleteAtBeginning: List: 10 15 20 30 --> Null
DeleteAtEnd: List: 10 15 20 --> Null
DeleteAtPosition(2): List: 10 20 --> Null

# 📘 Concepts Covered :

• Object-Oriented Programming

• Linked Data Structures

• Pointer Manipulation

• Edge Case Handling (empty list, invalid positions)
